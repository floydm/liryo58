# Liryo58
Liryo58 is a 6x4_5 keys handwired split keyboard based on the [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58) and [Sofle](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard).

Liryo, named after the Tagalog word for ‘Lily,’ draws inspiration from two of my favorite split keyboard designs: the Lily58 and the Sofle. My handwired version of the [TBK-Mini](https://github.com/Bastardkb/TBK-Mini) served me well, but I longed for a number row and additional thumb keys. This project provided the perfect chance to create a keyboard tailored to my preferences. And voilà, here she is!
